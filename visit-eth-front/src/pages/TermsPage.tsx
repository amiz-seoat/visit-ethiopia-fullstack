              Cancellation by Visit Ethiopia
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              We reserve the right to cancel any trip due to insufficient
              enrollment or other factors that make operation unfeasible. If we
              cancel a trip, all payments received will be refunded in full.
              This is the limit of our liability. Visit Ethiopia is not
              responsible for additional expenses incurred by participants in
              preparing for the trip (e.g., non-refundable airline tickets, visa
              fees, equipment, etc.).

              administration fee of $50 may apply, in addition to any difference
              in price for the altered arrangements. Changes requested less than
              30 days before departure may be treated as a cancellation and
              rebooking, subject to cancellation charges as outlined above.
